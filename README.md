# Family Sans

Family Sans is an example font family.
Its invisible corners make it perfect for feeling and work great at any size. 
It is suitable for headlines and captions, and maintains its distinct design.

The Latin component was designed by Mrs Someone Designer ([Foundry](http://www.foundry.com)). 
The Other component was designed by Mr Else Named ([Another Foundry](http://www.another-foundry.com)). 

The Family Sans project is led by Mrs Someone Designer, a type designer based in Place.
